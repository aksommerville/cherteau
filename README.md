# Cherteau

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

Code For A Cause Micro Jam, July 2025, theme "EVERY ACTION HAS A COST".

- Formal RPG, single-screen outer world maps.
- Combat will be mini-games a la Bellacopia Maleficia, but maybe only 3 or 4 of them.
- Every screen has toll doors, whose tolls increase with every step you take.
- Ideal play has you limiting activity in new rooms, until you've farmed enough gold to open all the doors.

## Agenda

- Thu 3 July: Navigable outer world, placeholder combat, toll doors.
- Fri 4 July: Mini games.
- Sat 5 July: Full world, graphics.
- Sun 6 July: Hello, game over, audio, polish.
- Submissions open until noon Monday. Submit by EOD Sunday.
